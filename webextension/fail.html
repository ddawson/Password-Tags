    <p>
      An attempt to migrate your tags, metadata, and settings into the
      WebExtension format has failed for some unknown reason! This data may not
      be available in Firefox 57 and after, unless it can be successfully
      migrated. Once this add-on becomes a WebExtension, an option may be
      provided that will allow you to import it from the legacy file.
